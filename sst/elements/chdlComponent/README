CHDL Component for SST
======================

1. Architecture
---------------

The CHDL component provides a way to execute gate-level netlists generated with
the CHDL Hardware Design Libary. This is a C++ structural hardware design
system notably employed in the implementation of the Harmonica multithreaded
SIMD soft core.

2. Configuration
----------------

2.1 HDL Parameters
------------------

clockFreq - required

  The frequency at which the CHDL clock is advanced

netlist - required

  The CHDL .nand netlist file

2.2 Ports
---------

mem - required - MemEvent (bidirectional)

  The primary interface to the memory system.

3. Getting Started
------------------

3.1 Requirements
----------------

The following software is needed in order to use the QSim component with SST:

  - Relatively recent Linux distribution
  - QSim 0.2 or later

3.2 Setting up QSim
-------------------

A detailed set of installation instructions for QSim can be found in the file
INSTALL in the QSim root directory.

3.3 Setting up SST
------------------

To run a simple test:

  $ emacs gen_sdl.c

    Change the constant "APP" at the top of the file to the path of a QSim
    benchmark .tar file (more on which in the QSim documentation).

  $ gcc -o gen_sdl gen_sdl.c
  $ ./gen_sdl 11 > test_11.xml
  $ mpirun -np 11 sst.x test_11.xml --stop-at 1ms
