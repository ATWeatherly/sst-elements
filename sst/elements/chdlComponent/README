CHDL Component for SST
======================

1. Architecture
---------------

The CHDL component provides a way to execute gate-level netlists generated with
the CHDL Hardware Design Libary. This is a C++ structural hardware design
system notably employed in the implementation of the Harmonica multithreaded
SIMD soft core. The interface provided is an exposure of the SimpleMem::Request
type, allowing interoperability of CHDL netlists and MemHierarchy components.

2. Configuration
----------------

2.1 HDL Parameters
------------------

clockFreq - required

  The frequency at which the CHDL clock is advanced

netlist - required

  The CHDL .nand netlist file

2.2 Ports
---------

mem - required - MemEvent (bidirectional)

  The primary interface to the memory system.
