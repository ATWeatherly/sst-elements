The iris library includes models for on-chip routers. The end terminal models
integrated with are in the ../portals4_sm folder.

How to run a simulation with IRIS
---------------------------------
Turn on the USE_IRIS flag in ../portals4_sm/trig_nic/trig_nic.h
    cd sst/elements/portals4_sm
    make
    make install

    cd ../iris
    sst.x test_v2.xml

Run the routers at flit level
-----------------------------
Rename the *_flit.cc and *_flit.h files to *.cc and *.h respectively
Recompile both the portals4_sm and iris libs i.e.

    cd sst/elements/portals4_sm;make; make install
    cd ../iris; make ; make install

Use the same example run as above
    sst.x test_v2.xml
