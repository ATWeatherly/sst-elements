The iris library includes models for on-chip routers. The end terminal models
integrated with are in the ../portals4_sm folder.

How to run a simulation with IRIS
---------------------------------
Libraries needed for simulation libportals4_sm and libiris:
    cd sst/elements/portals4_sm
    make; make install (sudo if installed with root)

    cd ../iris
    make; make install (sudo if installed with root)
    sst.x test_v2.xml

Run the routers at flit level
-----------------------------
Rename the *_flit.cc and *_flit.h files to *.cc and *.h respectively
Recompile iris libs i.e.
    cd ../iris; make; make install (sudo if installed with root)

Use the same example run as above
    sst.x test_v2.xml
