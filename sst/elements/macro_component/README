-------- SST/macro Element --------

This element is a wrapper for SST/macro V2.3.  

Contact Gilbert Hendry (ghendry@sandia.gov) for questions.

Bulding:

First, get SST/macro V2.3 from http://bitbucket.org/ghendry/sstmacro, and follow build and install instructions. Make sure 
the bin directory of your installed SST/macro is in your PATH (the sstmacro-config script gets called when linking against it).

Use exactly boost 1.50_0 when building SST/micro.  This is the version of boost that SST/macro V2.3 includes in its installation,
and using different versions of boost in the same executable could get wierd.  


Running:

Use makeSDL.pl to generate the SDL file.  Usage is as follows:

./makeSDL.pl [num of nodes] [unused, just say 0] [set, say 1 for now] [num of ranks]

so for example:

./makeSDL.pl 10 0 1 8

runs 8 ranks on 10 nodes.  By default the app name is "MPI_testall", which is just a test skeleton that
executes a bunch of MPI calls.  To run your own skeleton, you'll have to change the app name and give the
skeleton parameters.  



Known Issues:

-Using the "timestamps" debug flag will not produce accurate timestamps. Simulation time is still correct, just the debugger
   doesn't have a global timer object to query time on.

-The simulation is not yet parallelizable. This may be supported in SST/macro V2.4.
