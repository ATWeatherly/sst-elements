- Make ghost_pattern.cc code more modular to make it easier to expand

- Play with component weight

- Implement checkpointing
    - Coordinated
    - Uncoordinated with pessimistic msg logging
    - RAID

- More patterns
    - FFT
    - Master/Slave
    - Integer Sort (IS)

- Metrics
    - Decide on what metrics to collect
	- Power and temp for routers
	- Application run time
	- Storage size for logs and checkpoints

    - Collect metrics at end of simulation and print

- Router model needs to implement a getPower method
    Basically number of port accesses since last power query
    Introspector will call this periodically

- Multiple generators per router
    - Will messages between "cores" still go through router?
	For now, yes, but we make the links between routers
	and pattern generators much faster to emulate intra-node
	speeds....
