In order to build for the SST, all you have to do is make sure you're using the
wrapper compiler (i.e. CXX=powerpc-sst-darwin8.11.0-g++), and a version of
qthreads (with or without cprops) that has also been compiled for the simulator
(see the documentation of qthreads to find out how to build it for the SST).
