Notes:

You need to install *all* disksim libraries before this will work.  
libdisksim does not automatically give you all libraries built in the
disksim package.
These libraries are:
libdisksim.a
libparam.a
libddbg.a
libmemsmodel.a
libmems_internals.a
libdiskmodel.a

When running this, make certain that _all_ related disk parameter
files are in the location you are running from.  Otherwise, errors will 
result.
